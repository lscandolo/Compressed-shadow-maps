# Compressed shadow maps demo

This project contains a demo for the compressed shadow maps project based on merged multiresolution hierarchies. This structure allows the creation and usage of very large shadow maps (up to and upwards of 1 million x 1 million resolution) while using only a few MB of video memory. Compressed shadow maps are a very efficient method for creating shadows for large scale static geometry.

The details of this project can be found in the following publications:

*The project is prepared to be run in Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 through premake. Using the premake-vs201X.bat batch file will generate the solution in the build directory. CUDA is necessary for the creation and (optionally) the evaluation of the compressed shadow maps.*
